\section{\label{sec:History-7-9}Development Release Series 7.9}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is the development release series of HTCondor.
The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-9-3}Version 7.9.3}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 7.9.3 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 7.9.3 released on Month Date, 2012.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item When NEGOTIATOR\_CONSIDER\_PREEMPTION is false, the \Condor{negotiator}
now fetches machine ads more quickly from the collector by skipping most
attributes of the busy machines.  This can make negotiation much faster in
a very large pool of mostly claimed machines.
\Ticket{3366}

\item Exposed the quantization level for windowed statistics to
configuration with the parameter \Macro{STATISTICS\_WINDOW\_QUANTUM}.
\Ticket{3288}

\item \emph{This item is tentative, and must be reviewed or updated
before release of 7.9.3.}
\Condor{submit} now supports first-class syntax for specifying
accounting groups, via the 'group' and 'group\_user' commands.  The
separator character between group name and user name on internal
representations is now configurable with \Macro{GROUP\_SEPARATOR}.
Refer to section~\ref{sec:group-accounting} for more information.
\Ticket{2728}

\item Round-robin scheduling is now used when there are multiple users
waiting to transfer files in the limits set by
\Macro{MAX\_CONCURRENT\_UPLOADS} and/or
\Macro{MAX\_CONCURRENT\_DOWNLOADS}.  Previously, the file transfer
queue was scheduled in first-in-first-out order, so one user with
many files to transfer could delay other users for as long as it took
to transfer those files.  Now, when choosing a new job to allow to
transfer, the first job belonging to the user who has least
recently been given an opportunity to transfer will be selected.
The old behavior, or variations on the new behavior, can be achieved
by configuring \Macro{TRANSFER\_QUEUE\_USER\_EXPR}.
\Ticket{3333}

\item \Condor{dagman} will now try twice to write a POST script terminate
event, rather than trying once and exiting. \Condor{dagman} exits, writing
a rescue DAG, if it is unable to write the event.
\Ticket{965}

\item The \Condor{gridmanager} now cleans up temporary files and directories
that are sometimes left by the batch\_gahp when executing a grid-type
\SubmitCmd{batch} job.
\Ticket{3276}

\item Added counts of nodes in various states to the \Condor{dagman}
node status file.  Refer to section~\ref{sec:DAG-node-status} for
more information.
\Ticket{2728}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item A change was made to more accurately implement the
minimum time defined by the configuration variable
\Macro{NEGOTIATOR\_CYCLE\_DELAY}. 
\Ticket{3332}

\item The \Prog{batch\_gahp} is no longer dependent on the Perl module 
\Code{XML::Simple} when submitting jobs to SGE.
\Ticket{3350}

\item The batch\_gahp now properly handles job X.509 proxies that aren't
in the old proxy format.
\Ticket{3362}

\item On 32-bit platforms a \Macro{STARTER\_RLIMIT\_AS} value larger than 4096 could
cause jobs to abort on startup.  Values larger than 2047 have no real meaning on 32-bit
platforms, so values larger than 2047 are treated as no limit on 32-bit platforms.
\Ticket{3309}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-9-2}Version 7.9.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

%\item HTCondor version 7.9.2 not yet released.
\item HTCondor version 7.9.2 released on December 11, 2012.
This release contains all of the bug fixes in the version 7.8.6 
stable release,
and most of the bug fixes in the
soon to be released version 7.8.7 stable release.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item The permissions for the temporary execute directory of a job
have been tightened for vanilla universe jobs, 
such that only the owner of the job is allowed to see or
modify the contents.
\Ticket{3315}

\item Added experimental support for EC2 spot instances.
\Ticket{3209}

\item (This feature was added in version 7.9.1.)  
There are two new protocols for the submission of grid type EC2 jobs,
\Expr{euca3://} and \Expr{euca3s://}.
These protocols exist to work correctly when the resources do not support 
the \Param{InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior} parameter.
\Ticket{2974}

\item (This feature was added in version 7.9.1.)  
Added both a \Opt{-suppress\_notification},
a \Opt{-dont\_suppress\_notification} command line option,
and corresponding
\Macro{DAGMAN\_SUPPRESS\_NOTIFICATION} configuration variable
to \Condor{dagman} and \Condor{submit\_dag}.
This enables a user of DAGMan to stop email notification of job
events for jobs submitted by \Condor{dagman}. The value of
\MacroNI{DAGMAN\_SUPPRESS\_NOTIFICATION} defaults to \Expr{True},
so that jobs submitted
by \Condor{dagman} will not send email notification. 
\Ticket{3352}

\item The default for job notification email has changed
from \Expr{Complete} to \Expr{Never}. 
There is also a new configuration variable, \Macro{JOB\_DEFAULT\_NOTIFICATION},
which permits administrators to change the default for all jobs.
\Ticket{2155}

\item For platforms supporting cgroups,
resource limits can now be applied per job,
where a job may consist of multiple processes.
See section~\ref{sec:Resource-Limits-Cgroup} for details.
\Ticket{2734}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{MEMORY\_LIMIT}
supports implementing memory resource limits on a per-job basis under cgroups.
\Ticket{2734}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{schedd} and \Condor{shadow} were not respecting the
\Macro{DAGManNodesMask} attribute. This caused extra events to be written to
the DAGMan node log.
\Ticket{3311}

\item Removed a spurious newline from the output of \Condor{submit}.
\Ticket{3316}

\item Fixed a bug that caused the \Condor{shadow} to set job attribute
\Attr{X509UserProxySubject} to the wrong value when the job's X.509
proxy file was updated. It incorrectly set the value to be 
the proxy's subject name, rather than to the correct value, which is
its identity.
\Ticket{3265}

\item The \Prog{batch\_gahp} no longer modifies the environment variable
\Env{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH}.
In some instances, modifying \Env{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} caused the
batch system's command line tools to fail when run by the \Prog{batch\_gahp}.
\Ticket{3317}

\item Grid-type \SubmitCmd{batch} jobs now work properly on machines
where the gLite software has been installed.
\Ticket{3269}

\item The \Condor{shadow} would never print the allocated amount of
partitionable resources in the job log.
\Ticket{3318}

\item \Condor{who} would sometimes incorrectly display blank or partial
values in the PROGRAM column.
\Ticket{3314}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-9-1}Version 7.9.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.9.1 released on October 22, 2012.

\item Condor no longer looks for its main configuration file in the
location \File{\MacroUNI{GLOBUS\_LOCATION}/etc/condor\_config}.
\Ticket{2830}

\item \Security This version contains an important security bug fix.  See below
for details of this and other bugs fixed.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item There are two new protocols for the submission of grid type EC2 jobs,
\Expr{euca3://} and \Expr{euca3s://}.
These protocols exist to work correctly when the resources do not support 
the \Param{InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior} parameter.
\Ticket{2974}

\item \Condor{job\_router} can now submit the routed copy of jobs to a
different \Condor{schedd} than the one that serves as the source of
jobs to be routed.  The spool directories of the two
\Condor{schedds} must still be directly accessible to
\Condor{job\_router}.  This feature is enabled by using the new
optional configuration settings:

\begin{itemize}
\item \Macro{JOB\_ROUTER\_SCHEDD1\_SPOOL}
See definition at section~\ref{param:JobRouterSchedd1Spool}.
\item \Macro{JOB\_ROUTER\_SCHEDD2\_SPOOL}
See definition at section~\ref{param:JobRouterSchedd2Spool}.
\item \Macro{JOB\_ROUTER\_SCHEDD1\_NAME}
See definition at section~\ref{param:JobRouterSchedd1Name}.
\item \Macro{JOB\_ROUTER\_SCHEDD2\_NAME}
See definition at section~\ref{param:JobRouterSchedd2Name}.
\item \Macro{JOB\_ROUTER\_SCHEDD1\_POOL}
See definition at section~\ref{param:JobRouterSchedd1Pool}.
\item \Macro{JOB\_ROUTER\_SCHEDD2\_POOL}
See definition at section~\ref{param:JobRouterSchedd2Pool}.
\end{itemize}
\Ticket{3030}

\item The \Condor{job\_router} can now optionally transform jobs in place,
rather than creating a second transformed version (copy) of the job.
\Ticket{3185}

\item The \Condor{defrag} daemon now has a policy option implemented
by configuration to cancel the draining
of a machine that is in the Draining mode.  This can be used to effect
partial draining of machines.
\Ticket{2993}

\item Communication between the \Condor{c-gahp} and the \Condor{schedd} has
been improved. A large number of Condor-C jobs should no longer cause
other clients of the remote \Condor{schedd} to time out trying to get the
\Condor{schedd} daemon's attention.
\Ticket{2575}

\item \Condor{history} and \Condor{q} can now be told to read job records
from a user log, instead of parsing the history file or querying the
\Condor{schedd}.  This can be used to monitor the status of jobs with
reduced load on the \Condor{schedd}.
\Ticket{3188}

\item Eucalyptus 3.x support has been added to the EC2 GAHP.
\Ticket{2974}

\item File transfer remaps now support remapping directories.
\Ticket{3039}

\item The \Condor{schedd} can now dynamically spawn a local \Condor{startd}
to manage local universe jobs.
\Ticket{3129}

\item \Condor{q} \Opt{-jobads} will now respect the \Opt{-constraint} option.
\Ticket{3191}

\item Added BOSCO, a set of tools that makes it easy to use a Personal
Condor to run jobs on remote batch systems without administrator
assistance or manual installation of software on the remote systems.
See \URL{https://twiki.grid.iu.edu/bin/view/CampusGrids/BoSCO} for more
information about BOSCO.
\Ticket{2421}

\end{itemize}


\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Dynamic slots now fill the values for attributes of with names
that begin with
\Attr{TotalSlot}, 
for configured local resources in a way consistent with standard resources
such as \Attr{TotalSlotCpus}.
Previously those values were all given the value zero on dynamic slots.
\Ticket{3229}

\item The \Condor{schedd} now advertises the value of configuration variable
\MacroNI{COLLECTOR\_HOST} as attribute \Attr{CollectorHost} in 
its daemon ClassAd.  This allows one to determine if a given
\Condor{schedd} reporting to a \Condor{collector} is flocking to that 
\Condor{collector} or not.
\Ticket{3202}

\item Added the attribute \Attr{DAGManNodesMask} to control the verboseness of
the log referred to by \Attr{DAGManNodesLog}.
\Ticket{3351}

\item The new configuration variable
\Macro{QUEUE\_SUPER\_USER\_MAY\_IMPERSONATE} specifies a regular
expression that matches the user names that
the queue super user may impersonate when managing jobs.  When not
set, the default behavior is to allow impersonation of any user who
has had a job in the queue during the life of the \Condor{schedd}.  For
proper functioning of the \Condor{shadow}, the \Condor{gridmanager}, and
the \Condor{job\_router}, this expression, if set, must match the owner
names of all jobs that these daemons will manage.
\Ticket{3030}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{DEFRAG\_CANCEL\_REQUIREMENTS}
is an expression that specifies which draining machines should have 
draining be canceled.  
This defaults to \MacroUNI{DEFRAG\_WHOLE\_MACHINE\_EXPR}.  
This could be used to drain partial rather than whole machines.
\Ticket{2993}

\item The new submit command \SubmitCmd{use\_x509userproxy} can be set
to \Expr{True} to indicate that an X.509 user proxy is required for the job. 
If \SubmitCmd{x509userproxy} is not set, 
then the proxy file will be looked for in the standard locations.
\Ticket{3025}

\item If \Condor{submit} is used to submit an interactive job,
and the job is interrupted before the interactive job starts,
an attempt is made to immediately remove the interactive job from the queue.
Similarly, \Condor{ssh\_to\_job} has a new option \Opt{-remove-on-interrupt}.
\Ticket{3242}

\item Changes to were made to the ClassAd machine attributes 
\Attr{OpSys}, \Attr{OpSysVer}, \Attr{Distro}, as well as others,
in order to do a better job of identifying the operating system.
\Ticket{2366}

\item \Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_MAX\_SUBMITTED\_JOBS\_PER\_RESOURCE} can now be a
list, specifying different values for different hosts.
\Ticket{3220}

\item The new configuration parameter \Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_JOB\_PROBE\_RATE}
limits the number of job status requests sent to each remote resource.
\Ticket{3023}

\item The default value of \Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_JOB\_PROBE\_INTERVAL} has
changed from 300 to 60.
\Ticket{3023}.

\item The configuration parameters \Macro{CONDOR\_JOB\_POLL\_INTERVAL} and
\Macro{INFN\_JOB\_POLL\_INTERVAL} should no longer be used. Use
\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_JOB\_PROBE\_INTERVAL\_CONDOR} and
\Macro{GRIDMANAGER\_JOB\_PROBE\_INTERVAL\_BATCH} instead.
\Ticket{3023}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Security Fixed a bug which allowed jobs submitted to the standard
universe to escalate privilege on the submit machine and execute code as 
\Login{root}.
(CVE-2012-5390)
\Ticket{3268}

\item A fix only invokes Globus callouts when actually needed, 
thereby avoiding a program segfault if
the call out mechanism is misconfigured or broken.
\Ticket{2104}

\item Fixed a bug in all daemons wherein the \Attr{DaemonStartTime} attribute 
in the ClassAd for all daemons would be reset to the current time when they are
reconfigured.
\Ticket{3235}

\item Fixed a bug wherein the \Arg{-dont\_use\_default\_node\_log} command line flag
to \Condor{submit\_dag} had no effect.
\Ticket{3352}

\item \Security Although not user-visible, 
there were multiple updates that removed places
in the code where potential buffer overruns could occur, 
thus preventing potential attacks.  
None of these overruns were known to be exploitable.

\item \Security Although not user-visible, 
there were updates to the code to improve
the error checking of system calls,
thereby removing some potential security threats.  
None were known to be exploitable.

\item \Security Although not user-visible, 
removed some code that was no longer used.
The presence of this code could have led to a Denial-of-Service attack,
which would allow an attacker to stop another user's jobs from running.

\item \Security Filesystem (FS) authentication was improved to check 
the UNIX permissions of the directory used for authentication.  
Without this, an attacker may have
been able to impersonate another submitter on the same submit machine.

\item The \Condor{negotiator} now checks the accountant log file for sanity
once only on start up,  
thereby increasing efficiency of iteration through 
the accountant ClassAd log structure.
\Ticket{3011}

\item The ClassAd functions \Procedure{splitUserName} and 
\Procedure{splitSlotName}
no longer leak a small amount of memory each time they are evaluated.  
This bug was introduced when these functions were added in Condor version 7.7.6.
\Ticket{3082}

\item There are several bug fixes for grid-type batch jobs:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Monitoring the status of jobs submitted to PBS and SGE has been
    improved. \Ticket{3067} \Ticket{3157} \Ticket{3181}
  \item Job command-line arguments containing 
    left parenthesis, \verb@(@, right parenthesis, \verb@)@, 
    and ampersand, \verb@&@, characters are now handled properly. 
    \Ticket{3057}
  \item Removing PBS jobs that have just completed no longer causes the jobs
    to become held. \Ticket{3016}
  \item Added a work-around for a bug when submitting jobs to
    a Condor pool running Condor versions 7.7.6 through 7.8.2.
    A bug in \Condor{history} \Opt{-f} caused an error in determining
    a job's status.
    \Ticket{3133}
  \item Improved the handling of job files when the batch system has a shared
    file system. \Ticket{3195}
  \end{itemize}

\item Changes introduced in Condor version 7.9.0 caused jobs submitted by
\Condor{dagman} in the local universe to not write to the default node log file,
when \Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} was \Expr{True} (the default),
and a user log was also defined. This is fixed. 
\Ticket{3111}

\item Fixed a bug introduced in Condor version 7.9.0 that caused grid type
cream jobs to be held with a hold reason of 
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
  CREAM_Delegate Error: Cannot set credentials in the gsoap-plugin context.
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize
\Ticket{3234}

\item Fixed a problem that could have caused the \Condor{collector} to crash
when receiving an invalid packet.
\Ticket{3161}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Known Bugs:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Additions and Changes to the Manual:

\begin{itemize}

\item None.

\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-7-9-0}Version 7.9.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item Condor version 7.9.0 released on August 16, 2012.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Machine slots can now be configured to identify and
divide customized local resources.
Jobs may then request these resources.
See section~\ref{sec:Configuring-SMP} for details.
\Ticket{2905}

\item Condor now supports and implements the caching of ClassAds 
to reduce memory footprints. 
This feature is experimental and is currently disabled by default.
It can be enabled by setting
the new configuration variable \Macro{ENABLE\_CLASSAD\_CACHING}
to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{2541}
\Ticket{3127}

\item \Condor{status} now returns the \Condor{schedd} ClassAd directly 
from the \Condor{schedd} daemon,
if both options \Opt{-direct} and \Opt{-schedd} are given on the command line.
\Ticket{2492}

\item The new \Opt{-status} and \Opt{-echo} command line options to 
\Condor{wait} command cause it to show job start and terminate information,
and to print events to \Code{stdout}.
\Ticket{2926}

\item Added a \Expr{DEBUG} logging level output flag \Dflag{CATEGORY},
which causes Condor to include the logging level
flags in effect for each line of logged output.
\Ticket{2712}

\item \Condor{status} and \Condor{q} each have a new \Opt{-autoformat} option
to make some output format specifications easier than the existing
\Opt{-format} option.
See the \Condor{status} manual page located on page~\pageref{man-condor-status}
and the \Condor{q} manual page located on page~\pageref{man-condor-q} 
for details.
\Ticket{2941}

\item Enhanced the ClassAd log system to report the log line number 
on parse failures, 
and improved the ability to detect parse failures closer to 
the point of corruption.
\Ticket{2934}

\item Added an \Opt{-evaluate} option to \Condor{config\_val}, which causes the configured value queried from
a given daemon to be evaluated with respect to that daemon's ClassAd.
\Ticket{856}

\item Added code to \Condor{dagman},
such that a \Expr{VARS} assignment in a top-level DAG is applied to splices.
\Ticket{1780}

\item Condor now uses libraries from Globus 5.2.1.
\Ticket{2838}

\item When authenticating Condor daemons with GSI and
configuration variable \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} is undefined, 
Condor checks that the server name in the certificate matches the 
host name that the client is connecting to. 
When \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} is defined,
the old behavior is preserved: only certificates matching
\MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} pass the authentication step, 
and no host name check is performed.  
The behavior of the host name check
may be further controlled with the new configuration variables
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK} and
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK\_CERT\_REGEX}.
\Ticket{1605}

\item Added new capability to \Condor{submit} to allow recursive macros in
submit description files. 
This facility allows one to update variables recursively. 
Before this new capability was added,
recursive definition would send \Condor{submit} into an
infinite loop of expanding the macro,
such that the expansion would fill up memory.
See section~\ref{macro-in-submit-description-file} for details.
\Ticket{406}

\item A DAGMan limitation and restriction has been removed.  
It is now permitted to define a \SubmitCmd{log} command using a macro,
within a node job's submit description file.
\Ticket{2428}

\item To enforce the dependencies of a DAG,
DAGMan now uses and watches only the default node
user log of the \Condor{dagman} job for events.  
DAGMan requests the \Condor{schedd} and \Condor{shadow} daemons to write each
event to this default log, 
in addition to writing to a log specified by the node job.
\Condor{dagman} writes POST script terminate events only to its default log;
these terminate events are not written to the user log.
This behavior can be turned off by setting the configuration variable
\Macro{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} to \Expr{False}.
For correct behavior,
\MacroNI{DAGMAN\_ALWAYS\_USE\_NODE\_LOG} should be set to \Expr{False}
if \Condor{dagman} version 7.9.0 or later is submitting jobs 
to an older version of
a \Condor{schedd} daemon or of a \Condor{submit} executable.
\Ticket{2807}

\item \Condor{submit} has a new \Opt{-interactive} option for
platforms other than Windows,
which schedules and runs a job that provides a shell prompt
on the execute machine.
\Ticket{3088}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Configuration Variable and ClassAd Attribute Additions and Changes:

\begin{itemize}

\item The new configuration variables \Macro{MACHINE\_RESOURCE\_NAMES}
(see section~\ref{param:MachineResourceNames})
and \Macro{MACHINE\_RESOURCE\_<name>}
(see section~\ref{param:MachineResourceResourcename})
identify and specify the use of customized local machine resources.
\Ticket{2905}

\item The new configuration variable \MacroNI{ENABLE\_CLASSAD\_CACHING}
controls whether the new caching feature of ClassAds is used.
The default value is \Expr{False}.
\Ticket{3127}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{CLASSAD\_LOG\_STRICT\_PARSING}
controls whether ClassAd log files such as the job queue
log are read with strict parse checking on ClassAd expressions.
\Ticket{3069}

\item The default value for configuration variable \Macro{USE\_PROCD}
is now \Expr{True} for the \Condor{master} daemon.  
This means that by
default the \Condor{master} will start a \Condor{procd} daemon to be used 
by it and all other daemons on that machine.
\Ticket{2911}

\item There is a new configuration variable used by the \Condor{starter}.
If \Macro{STARTER\_RLIMIT\_AS} is set to an integer value, 
the \Condor{starter}
will use the \Procedure{setrlimit} system call with the 
\Code{RLIMIT\_AS} parameter to
limit the virtual memory size of each process in the user job.  
The value of this configuration variable is a ClassAd expression, 
evaluated in the context of both the machine and job ClassAds, 
where the machine ClassAd is the \Expr{my} ClassAd, 
and the job ClassAd is the \Expr{target} ClassAd.
\Ticket{1663}

\item New configuration variables were added to to the \Condor{schedd} to
define statistics that count subsets of jobs. 
These variables have the form \Macro{SCHEDD\_COLLECT\_STATS\_BY\_<Name>},
and should be defined by a ClassAd expression that evaluates to a string.
See section~\ref{param:ScheddCollectStatsByName}
for the complete definition.
The optional configuration variable of the form
\Macro{SCHEDD\_EXPIRE\_STATS\_BY\_<Name>} can be used to set an expiration time,
in seconds, for each set of statistics.
\Ticket{2862}

\item The new \SubmitCmd{batch\_queue} submit description file command
and new job ClassAd attribute \Attr{BatchQueue} specify which job
queue to use for grid universe jobs of type
\SubmitCmd{pbs}, \SubmitCmd{lsf}, and \SubmitCmd{sge}.
\Ticket{2996}

\item The new configuration variable \Macro{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK} is
a boolean that controls whether a check is performed during
GSI authentication of a Condor daemon.  
When the default value \Expr{False},
the check is not skipped, so the daemon host name must match the
host name in the daemon's certificate, unless otherwise exempted
by values of \MacroNI{GSI\_DAEMON\_NAME} or
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK\_CERT\_REGEX}.
When \Expr{True}, this check is skipped, and hosts will not be rejected
due to a mismatch of certificate and host name.
\Ticket{1605}

\item The new configuration variable
\MacroNI{GSI\_SKIP\_HOST\_CHECK\_CERT\_REGEX} may be set to a
regular expression.  GSI certificates of Condor daemons with a
subject name that are matched in full by this regular expression
are not required to have a matching daemon host name and certificate
host name.  The default is an empty regular expression, which will
not match any certificates, even if they have an empty subject name.
\Ticket{1605}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug in which usage of cgroups incorrectly included the page cache 
in the maximum memory usage.
This bug fix is also included in Condor version 7.8.2.
